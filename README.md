## Description

This project is designed to test your knowledge of front-end web technologies and assess your ability to create front-end UI products with attention to details, cross-browser compatibility, standards, and reusability.

## Mandatory Features

- [x] Ability to add a new "reminder" (max 30 chars) for a user entered day and time. Also, include a city.

- [x] Allow the user to select color when creating a reminder and display it appropriately.
- [x] Ability to edit reminders â€“ including changing text, city, day, time and color.
- [x] Add a weather service call from a free API such as Open Weather Map, and get the weather forecast (ex. Rain) for the date of the calendar reminder based on the city.
- [x] Unit test the functionality: Ability to add a new "reminder" (max 30 chars) for a user entered day and time. Also, include a city.

## Bonus (Optional)
